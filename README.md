-Hello everyone lets  start the project
-We will be using the following tools and technologies
 -react
 -javascript
 -tailwind
 - use framer motion library for animation
 

 To provide the late text effects I used motion.div 
 which is the part of framer motion library in which we can provide the animation to the div
  <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}   // Initial state
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}   // Final state after animation
      transition={{ duration: 1 }} // Define transition duration
    >

 this code snipet can clear your doubts.
